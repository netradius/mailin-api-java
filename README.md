# SendinBlue Java Client

This is a forked version of the official SendinBlue Java API found at
https://github.com/mailin-api/mailin-api-java. The goals of this fork
are the following

 * Create an asset that can be added to a project with maven, ivy and gradle rather than being forced to copy source code
 * Version the client so it's easier to know what's included in each release
 * Modify the client so it follows a more traditional Java coding convention 

The official SendinBlue API documentation is located at https://apidocs.sendinblue.com.

SendinBlue API's use HTTP Authentication through an api key. You can create your api key from [API Console](https://my.sendinblue.com/advanced/apikey), after you sign up for an account with SendinBlue. You must use latest version 2.0, access key, for accessing APIs.
